# CoffeeMachine
Java interface to simulate coffee vending machine, runs in an IDE console environment.

## Task Description

Let's simulate a coffee machine. It has a limited supply of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups. Also, it counts how much money it gets for selling coffee.

The coffee machine has several options: first, it needs to be able to sell coffee. It can make different varieties of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Of course, each variety requires a different amount of supplies, except that all of them require only one disposable cup. Second, the coffee machine should be able to get replenished by a special worker. Third, another special worker should be able to take money from the coffee machine.

The program repeatedly asks what the user wants to do. If the user writes "buy" then they must choose one of three varieties of coffee that the coffee machine can make: espresso, latte, or cappuccino. If the user writes "fill", the program should ask them how much water, milk, coffee, and how many disposable cups they want to add to the coffee machine. If the user writes "take" the program should give them all the money that it earned from selling coffee. If the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, he should type "exit". Then the program should terminate. Also, when the user types "remaining", the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has.

Also, do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee. If the coffee machine doesnâ€™t have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee and state what is missing.

And the last improvement to the program -if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, he should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle.

Remember, that:

- At the start, the coffee machine has $550, 400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, and 9 disposable cups.
- For the espresso, the coffee machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans. It costs $4.
- For the latte, the coffee machine needs 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffee beans. It costs $7.
- And for the cappuccino, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffee. It costs $6.

## Example
Your coffee machine should have the same initial resources as in the example (400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, 9 disposable cups, $550 in cash).
The symbol `>` represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
